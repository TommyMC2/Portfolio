            <p>I want to start this reflection by being honest with the fact that I am incredibly
                biased regarding website development. When I started this class, I had limited
                coding experience since I had only ever used Python and had only spent about a week
                using HTML. While my experience with the HTML and CSS language is minimal, using
                oxygen and GitHub felt much more engaging than using the PSU site builder. </p>
            <p>When you first start, coding is daunting and seems inefficient, but similarly to when
                I was using Python in high school, I started getting things to work, and it became
                fun again. It is nice being forced to work with the code because it makes learning
                how each line of code interacts a necessity, while on the PSU site, you can switch
                to the edit screen and change things like its word document. For people who want a
                website, the PSU site builder is an excellent option because coding becomes more
                optional than with GitHub, but for someone who wants a career in web design, getting
                down to the base elements of creating a website is the way to go.</p>
            <p>I compared the site builder to a Microsoft Word document, and I did that because I
                think that is what they were trying to do. Word is a program most people understand,
                and if they do not, it is straightforward to learn, so making the edit page more
                like Word makes it much more accessible to the average person. For most people,
                going through the code and changing the CSS style sheet to center a line of text or
                picture will be much more complicated than the PSU site and its ability to change
                things without interacting with code. On the other hand, GitHub is much more
                complicated, from coding to website updates. It takes multiple steps to make changes
                to a website through GitHub, while on the PSU site, it is as easy as hitting the
                "Save Changes" button.</p>
            <p>Some coding knowledge is good for both websites, but the PSU site goes out of its way
                to make coding unnecessary for those without experience. The only skills required
                for the PSU site creator are a basic understanding of Word and some formatting
                basics. For the GitHub site, a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and GitHub commands
                will get you a long way to creating a functional website. I want to get better at
                visualizing how my code changes will impact my site, along with identifying the
                problems with my code.</p>
